#Using need we can make jobs are depend on another job
for example if build job execute then only script job will execute

#test.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "successfully script start executing"
ls -la

EG:
#.gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
    - build
    - deploy
    - test

build_job:
    stage: build
    image: busybox
    script:
        - echo "successfully run build jobs"

script_job:
    stage: build
    image: alpine
    script:
        - sh test.sh
        - echo "successfully run script jobs"
    needs:
        - build_job

test_job:
    stage: test
    script:
        - echo "successfully run test jobs"
    

deploy_job:
    stage: deploy
    image: busybox
    script:
        - echo "sucessfully run deploy jobs"
