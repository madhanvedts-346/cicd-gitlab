#Before and After if you want run any thing use before_script and after_script

#test.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "successfully script start executing"
ls -la

EG:
#.gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
    - build
    - deploy
    - test

build_job:
    stage: build
    image: busybox
    script:
        - echo "successfully run build jobs"

script_job:
    stage: build
    image: alpine
    before_script:
        - echo "script start excuting in before-script"
        - echo "start excuting in before-script"
    script:
        - sh test.sh
        - echo "successfully run script jobs"
    after_script:
        - echo "script execution done"

test_job:
    stage: test
    script:
        - echo "successfully run test jobs"
    

deploy_job:
    stage: deploy
    image: busybox
    script:
        - echo "sucessfully run deploy jobs"

1.first doubt
✅ GitLab CI: before_script Failure – What Happens Next?

Short answer:
❌ If before_script fails, then script will NOT execute
✅ after_script WILL execute (always)


2.second doubt

✅ GitLab CI: If after_script Fails – Will Remaining Stages Execute?

Short answer:
✔ YES — remaining stages WILL execute
Because: ❗ Failure in after_script does NOT affect job or pipeline status
